<h2>What is the Kazakhstan Exchange?</h2>
<p>The Kazakhstan Exchange is an exchange that was planned by Mr. Collins and Aidar Khoroshash, after Mr. Collins had visited the Nazarbayev Intellectual School with the CIS (Council Of International Schools) to decide whether NIS should be part of the CIS. After that, the Kazakhstan exchange was actively planned from both sides, and then after agreeing on the most important information around the exchange. This year (2017), the exchange took place from the 9th to the 15th September. ISHR has sent two students (Franka and Peer) and a teacher (Ms. García Villa) to Astana to visit the school. Then, from the 22nd to the 28th October, ten students and two teachers from NIS visited Hannover. This exchange was initially only planned as an experiment, however Mr. Collins and Mr. Khoroshash are working on making this exchange take place every year and increasing the number of students going to Kazakhstan.</p>

<h2>General Information about Kazakhstan</h2>
<p>Kazakhstan is a country located in Central Asia, however a part of the country is also located on the European continent. The official state language is Kazakh, however the Russian language is also recognized as an official language. The capital of Kazakhstan has changed in 1997 from Almaty to Astana. Although Kazakhstan is the 9th largest country on the planet with 2.725 million km² (almost 8x larger than Germany), Kazakhstan only has a population of 17.8 million. This is only one fifth of the population that Germany has (Kazakhstan has a population density of 6 people per km²). Approximately two thirds of the population are Muslims, and most of the others are Christians. However, although most of the people classify themselves as Muslims, the people are not very religious, as many restaurants also offer pork and many muslims eat pork. A large part of the country are steppes, and another small part of the country is rocky. The temperatures depends mostly on the part of the country that you're at, however generally in Summer it gets extremely hot with an average temperature of over 30°C, whereas in Winters, the average temperature is below -20°C. </p>

<h2>General Information about Germany</h2>
<p>Germany is a country located in central Europe. Its official language is German. German can have many accents depending on where it is spoken. The capital of Germany is Berlin, which is also a federal state at the same time. Germany has a total of 16 different federal states, of which 3 federal states are city states (cities being a federal state too). The population of Germany is about 82.67 million people. The area of Germany is 357,376 km², which makes it the 6th largest country in Europe, however still a lot smaller than Kazakhstan. Germany is a democracy and has freedom of speech. The main religion is Christianity with about 67%. A lot of people are also atheists or a branch of the Christian religion. Only 4% are Muslim and 1% of the entire population associate themselves with the religions of Judaism or Buddhism.</p>
 
<h2>The Kazakh-German Relationship</h2>
<p>The Kazakh-German relations really began in World War II, when many Germans that lived in Russia before, were relocated and imprisoned by the Soviet Union to Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan has declared its independence from the Soviet Union on December 16, 1991. At that moment in time, almost one million Germans lived in Kazakhstan, whereas nowadays approximately 180,000 Germans still live in Kazakhstan. There is not a lot of knowledge about Kazakhstan in Germany, as the iron curtain has kept these two countries as separate as they possibly can. This is also one of the reasons that I'm creating this website (to make the two countries more aware of each other, and improve the relationship ). Kazakhstan and Germany are very important trading partners, as the bilateral trade of 2016 was worth approximately 4 billion euros. While Germany mainly sells raw material and lots of new technology to Kazakhstan (to promote the industrialisation of Kazakhstan), Kazakhstan mainly exports oil, iron and steel to Germany. The point of sharing finite resources is very important to the current president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Kazakhstan's main finite resource is oil, of which it sells most to other countries. However, Kazakhstan also keeps a lot of oil to itself and does not share a lot of other finite resources either (e.g. the mineral industry, such as iron ore, coal, iron gold, copper or natural gas). The Kazakh government is also making a step towards becoming a green country too though, as it really promotes the use of green energy, as to which it has even hosted the EXPO 2017 on future energy.</p>
