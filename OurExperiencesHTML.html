<p>"I had the privilege of taking part in our first exchange with the NIS in Astana, which has most definitely made an impact on both my personal and professional life. I had the opportunity to co-teach some lessons, get to know Kazakh culture, and enjoy Astana, one of the most peculiar cities in the world. Kazakh people are extremely welcoming, and our experience in such a country was made much easier by the hospitality and help from our peers at our partner school in Astana."</p>

<p>"I was very honored to have the opportunity to participate in the exchange with the NIS in Astana. The exchange to Kazakhstan has really opened up my mind, as we have learnt a lot about the Kazakh culture, which we could also compare to our German culture. We have received probably the warmest welcoming culture from all the people that we have met during the exchange, whether they knew us or they didn't. The exchange has also been a lot of fun for all of the people involved (including the Kazakh students), since we did lots of fun activities. Also, I would recommend to everybody that is interested in learning about a new culture or also wants to meet new people from another country, to sign up for this exchange. As none of us spoke any Russian or Kazakh (although Ms. García Villa spoke a little Bulgarian), not being able to speak the language of the country you're visiting will not be a problem due to the Kazakh students helping."</p>

<p>In October this year I had the honor to participate in the student exchange organized at ISHR with the NIS school in Astana. Even though I have already participated in a couple of other exchanges before this one, I am proud to say that this experience has opened my eyes to new and exciting culture. Before I arrived in Astana I knew very little about the Kazakh culture and their way of living, but this experience has filled my knowledge gaps. I am convinced that this is true for every student, who took part in this exchange and that all of us can now say that we did not only find friends, but we found family in Astana.
I believe that living in a native family is by far the best way to get to know a different culture and I am delighted to know that I had the change to be part of this experience. 
My favorite memory of this trip was all the students that came up to me during the school times and introduced themselves to me. They all showed a great interest in my culture and were very welcoming towards me. 
Because of my extremely positive experiences I want to encourage everyone who wants to build lifelong friendships and loves experiencing new ways of living to take part in this great opportunity."</p>
