<h2>Differences: </h2>
        <p>A few of the differences between Germany and Kazakhstan were the religion, because here in Germany it is over two thirds Christianity and in Kazakhstan it is almost two thirds Muslim. It was surprising that there were only two big cities in the whole country and the rest were mostly smaller villages. There was also a lot of greenspace unaffected from pollution and littering. The roads were mostly made out of dirt outside of the city, because not as many cars drive past there. They also had meals involving a lot of meat and had totally different food than here in Germany. They also prepared the food in very different ways. The traditional clothing was also very different from German traditional clothing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another very big and important difference that exists between Germany and Kazakhstan, is the access to equal opportunities. Due to there being lots of little villages throughout the entire country, the education and the job opportunities vary a lot, on where you live. For example, the village schools do not really have the same opportunities to teach, as the schools in Astana or Almaty have (due to a lack of resources, such as computers, movies, few notebooks, etc.). Families in these rural areas often use up lots of their income to the education of their children. However, a positive trend can also be observed in the access to equal opportunities, as many schools (also including NIS) from the urban areas of the country, help the schools in the rural areas by supplying new ways to teach students and other practical aids. One thing that will be very difficult for rural schools to ever solve, would be that there are way too few teachers, which results in both, students and teachers having to stay up late in order to learn/teach (many schools have a system, where the students are divided into two groups, 1 group from 8am to 1pm, and the other group from 1pm to 6pm). The only way that this can be improved, is that the opportunities for students (that finished the final exam) to become teachers would have to be improved. </p>
